# Data Types
Python has the following built-in data types...

* str
* int
* float
* list, tuple
* dict
* bool
* None

Since Python interprets the variable on the go, you can use the following syntanx to define a variable

```PYTHON
    a = 10
    b = 10.95
    c = True
    d = 'this is a string'
    e = list((1, 2, 3))
    f = tuple((1, 2, 3))
    g = dict(
        {
            'key': 'value'
        }
    )
```
